# Collection of Dockerfiles

This is a collection of [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for generating [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) images for various software packages. This collection favors lean images built on top of [Alpine Linux](http://alpinelinux.org/) or [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) distributions due to their small footprint. Alpine has a `5MB` image while Debian has a `125MB` image. [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/), which is one of the most popular base distributions for Docker images, has a `188MB` image.
